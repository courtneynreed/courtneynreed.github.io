I am a researcher, designer, musician, and educator. <br>
By day, I am a Lecturer in the [Institute for Digital Technologies](https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/institutes/digital-technologies/) at Loughborough University London. ‚òÄÔ∏è <br>
By slightly-later-that-day, I work as a semi-professional vocalist in the UK and Germany. üå§Ô∏è



### what gets me out of bed

My research is in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), with my most keen interests in embodied interaction and movement perception. I want to understand more how people understand their actions, communicate with each other, and learn new skills, with the hope that we can design technology around these existing mechanisms. 

Three questions that really motivate me currently:

 1. How does digital technology, espectially work with AI, augment and/or change action/interactions and existing human relationships?
 2. How can/how *should* we designate and identify technology‚Äôs role in different scenarios, depending on the needs of stakeholders and applications?
 3. How can we understand these dynamic roles of technology and people in the messiness of the world and our subjective experience?

I am especially interested in music technology and working with singers; I have incorporated much of my work into my own vocal practice. For me, the key aspects of interaction with technology are individual and come from our own unique backgrounds ‚Äì with Feminist HCI at the core of my research, I aim to design and explore the relationships we have with technology while honoring subjective experience, the weirdness of bodies, and the messiness of learning and self-expression.

### the story (so far)



I have had the privilege of working with many incredible research labs in my career. I received my BMus in Electronic Production and Design at the Berklee College of Music (Boston, MA, USA) and my MSc in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London. I then completed my PhD in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London in the Centre for Digital Music as a member of the [Augmented Instruments Lab](http://instrumentslab.org/), led by Prof. Andrew McPherson (now Imperial College). I was previously a postdoctoral researcher in the [Sensorimotor Interaction Group](https://sensint.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) (senSInt) at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (Saarbr√ºcken, DE) with Dr. Paul Strohmeier, where I am currently an Affiliate/Visiting Researcher. I also worked on the [COSMOS ERC Grant](https://cosmos.isd.kcl.ac.uk/) at King's College London, under the direction of Prof. Elaine Chew.

### also...
If I'm not working on music tech, I am probably goofing around and performing with it. <br>
My solo project is called **agouti**, I compose with vocal textures and occasionally perform in London (hoping to do more soon!). <br>
I also perform with an electronic improv group called **Hyphae**, formed at the MPI, we perform regularly in Saarbr√ºcken and are branching out to other cities in the EU. <br>
I also sing regularly with the London Philharmonic Choir. üé∂

I love animals and have many pets, including a large group of fancy rats and two cats. üê≠üê±<br>
I am also the caretaker for many many *many* houseplants. üåø

<!-- Some of my current professional service includes exciting work as part of the Women in Music Information (WiMIR) Workshop Organizing Committee. The workshop operates as a satellite event to the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) and aims to unite and support women and other underrepresented community members working within music information retrieval (MIR). -->

<!-- I also work as a semi-professional vocalist and an amateur French horn player. Currently, I am a member of the London Philharmonic Choir and London Philharmonic Semi Chorus, and sing frequently as a session musician with Hi Lo Singers. -->
