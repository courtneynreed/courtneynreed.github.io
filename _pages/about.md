Hello, I'm Courtney~

I am a researcher, educator, and musician.

My research focuses on the roles and dynamic relationships between people, technology and the world around us. My goal is to uncover how we experience and understand interaction with our senses and bodies and how this can inform design.

As a musician, I am especially interested in the role technology has in human creativity. My work has centred around the interaction and relationship vocalists have with their voices --- both body and instrument --- and how technology mediates, informs, and even disrupts this connection.


<!-- Examples of this work in topics including human-centred design, biosignal feedback, autoethnography, and experience querying with micro-phenomenology. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
