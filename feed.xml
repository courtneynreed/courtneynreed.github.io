While I‚Äôm here, I will use this opportunity to reflect back on 2023 and some of the great research and teaching opportunities I had this year.</p> <h2 id="phd-defense">PhD Defense</h2> <p>I defended my PhD in January of this year! It was awesome and I had a great time discussing my work with my examiners, Prof. Alexander Jensenius from University of Oslo and Dr. George Fazekas from QMUL. <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Reed_PhD_ImaginingSensing.pdf">My PhD thesis can be found here.</a> üéì</p> <h2 id="new-jobs">New Job(s)</h2> <h3 id="postdoc--kcl-">Postdoc @ KCL ü´Ä</h3> <p>I started the year in January with a new postdoc, moving from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbr√ºcken to the School of Biomedical Engineering &amp; Imaging Sciences at King‚Äôs College London. I worked as part of the research team on the <a href="https://cosmos.isd.kcl.ac.uk/?page_id=2">COSMOS (Computational Shaping and Modeling of Musical Structures) ERC Advanced Grant</a>, led by Prof. Elaine Chew. I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Design Analytics and Music Physiology, focusing on human perception of musical stimuli.</p> <h3 id="lecturer--lul-">Lecturer @ LUL üë©üèº‚Äçüíª</h3> <p>Recently, in November, I left KCL and joined the <a href="https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/institutes/digital-technologies/">Institute for Digital Techhnologies at Loughborough University London</a> as a Lecturer. I am enjoying this new position so much already, particularly working with my students in the course I‚Äôm teaching - Digital Application Design - and introducing them to computer programming in Python. I‚Äôm looking forward to supervising projects and getting set up with my own grants and research work in the new year.</p> <p>As before, I remain an Affiliate Researcher in the <a href="https://sensint.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">Sensorimotor Interaction Group (senSInt)</a> at the MPI in Saarbr√ºcken, led by Dr. Paul Strohmeier, where I‚Äôm lucky to be able to continue my research work in interaction networks with my colleagues there. üíú</p> <h2 id="research">Research</h2> <p>A summary of some amazing work I got to collaborate on and publish this year. <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/papers/">All of these papers can be found here or are linked in-line:</a></p> <h3 id="conferences">Conferences</h3> <p><strong><a href="https://tei.acm.org/2023/">ACM Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI), Warsaw, PL</a></strong></p> <ul> <li>Ran a workshop on <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Haynes_TEI23_BeingMeaningful.pdf">designing for meaningful interaction</a> with the incomparable Dr. Alice Haynes, Dr. Sophie Skach, and Charlotte Nordmoen.</li> <li>Presented a paper from from my PhD work with Prof. Andrew McPherson, <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Reed_TEI23_BodyAsSound.pdf">examining vocalists‚Äô perceptions of their bodies and how existing sensory associations can be disrupted or strengthened with technology.</a></li> <li>Had a fun time taking the train from Saarbr√ºcken to Warsaw and back!</li> </ul> <p><strong><a href="https://2023.augmented-humans.org/">Augmented Humans International Conference (AHs), Glasgow, Scotland, UK</a></strong></p> <ul> <li>My colleague Nihar Sabnis from the MPI presented a paper and demo of senSInt‚Äôs work on <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Wittchen_AHs23_AugmentedShoes.pdf">designing haptic insoles for tactile augmented reality.</a></li> </ul> <p><strong><a href="https://chi2023.acm.org/">ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing (CHI), Hamburg, DE</a></strong></p> <ul> <li>Participated in the <em>Body X Materials Workshop</em>, discussing working with the <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Reed_CHI23_BodyLutherie.pdf">physiological materiality in my position paper about Body Lutherie.</a></li> <li>Presented a paper, also from my PhD work, on <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Reed_CHI23_VocalMetaphor.pdf">using metaphors from vocal pedagogy to reach mutual understanding about subjective experiences in design/HCI.</a></li> <li>My colleagues Nihar and Paul from the MPI presented two papers about senSInt‚Äôs work on <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Sabnis_CHI23_TactileSymbols.pdf">designing tactile symbols</a> and <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Sabnis_CHI23_HapticServos.pdf">Haptic Servos, our platform for rendering vibrotactile feedback.</a></li> <li>Our paper <em>Haptic Servos: Self-Contained Vibrotactile Rendering System for Creating or Augmenting Material Experiences</em> received an <strong>Honorable Mention for Best Paper!</strong> üèÜ</li> </ul> <p><strong><a href="https://www.nime2023.org/">New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), Mexico City, MX</a></strong></p> <ul> <li>Remotely a workshop with my colleagues Andrew and Eevee Zayas-Garin on methodologies for <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Reed_NIME23_QueryingExperience.pdf">querying subjective experiences in musical interaction.</a></li> </ul> <p><strong><a href="https://cinc2023.org/">Computing in Cardiology (CinC), Atlanta, GA, USA</a></strong></p> <ul> <li>My colleague Dr. Mateusz Soli≈Ñski presented two papers about methodological findings from the work of the COSMOS team on analysing music listeners‚Äô and performers‚Äô <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Solinski_CinC23_TriangleSimplex.pdf">heart rate variability using triangle simplex plots</a> and <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Solinski_CinC23_TRDanalysis.pdf">pairwise cardiac responses with Time Delay Stability (TDS) analysis.</a></li> </ul> <h3 id="springer-volume-creating-digitally">Springer Volume: <em>Creating Digitally</em></h3> <p>I published my first book chapter, one I worked on with Prof. Nick Bryan-Kinns, in <em>Creating Digitally.
