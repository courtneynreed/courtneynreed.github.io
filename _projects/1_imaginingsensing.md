**2019 - 2023**

My PhD at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) was done in the [Augmented Instruments Lab (AIL)](http://instrumentslab.org/) with Prof. Andrew McPherson. The work culmuninated in my thesis, [Imagining & Sensing: Understanding and Extending the Vocalist-Voice Relationship Through Biosignal Feedback](https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Reed_PhD_ImaginingSensing.pdf).

üèÜ This PhD was awarded the [ACM SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award](https://www.courtneynreed.com/blog/2024/dissertationaward/) in 2024 for contributions to the HCI community.

## abstract

The voice is body, instrument, and identity: To explore and unpack the relationship that vocalists have with their voices and vocal practice, this work involved autoethnographic research in my own singing and work with other vocalists and practices. 

This work also explores the tensions and opportunities between third-person view of the voice by listeners, sensors, and digital agents, and the critical, embodied, first-person relationship of the vocalist. The vocalist‚Äôs understanding of their multi-sensory experiences is through tacit knowledge of the body. This knowledge is difficult to articulate, yet awareness and control of the body are innate. In the ever-increasing emergence of technology which quantifies or interprets physiological processes, we must remain conscious also of embodiment and human perception of these processes. Focusing on the vocalist-voice relationship, this project expands knowledge of human interaction and how technology influences our perception of our bodies.

## contributions 

* [VoxEMG electromyography platform](https://www.courtneynreed.com/projects/2_voxemg/): a novel vocal interaction method which uses measurement of laryngeal muscular
activations through surface electromyography (sEMG). 
* Long-term first-person/autoethnographic and in-depth work with other vocalists on reflection on the incorporation of biosignal feedback understanding body movements and vocal practice and how such feedback can function as a metaphor.
* Comprehensive examination of how technology and the feedback we receive in human-computer interaction (HCI) can shape our perception and understanding of our bodies and our actions.
* Strategy for adopting technologies from other practices into traditional arts and other contexts through the use of soft wearables, e.g., the [Singing Knit EMG wearable](http://localhost:4000/assets/pdf/Reed_AHs22_SingingKnit.pdf).
* Analysis of how metaphors used in fundamental vocal pedagogy and how metaphorical communication between humans works; this proposed novel ways in which we can structure interaction with technology to aid in sensory communication.
* Biofeedback-based reflections on ways in which vocalists are in control and controlled by their voices, work with and against their bodies.
* Nuanced account of human interaction and perception of the body through vocal practice, as an example of how technological intervention enables exploration and influence over embodied understanding.
