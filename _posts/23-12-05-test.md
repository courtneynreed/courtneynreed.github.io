Every blog needs to start somewhere! While I'm here, I will use this opportunity to reflect back on 2023 and some of the great research and teaching opportunities I had this year.

## PhD Defense

I defended my PhD in January of this year! It was awesome and I had a great time discussing my work with my examiners, Prof. Alexander Jensenius from University of Oslo and Dr. George Fazekas from QMUL. <a href="https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Reed_PhD_ImaginingSensing.pdf">My PhD thesis can be found here.</a> üéì 

## New Job(s)

### Postdoc @ KCL ü´Ä

I started the year in January with a new postdoc, moving from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbr√ºcken to the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences at King's College London. I worked as part of the research team on the <a href="https://cosmos.isd.kcl.ac.uk/?page_id=2">COSMOS (Computational Shaping and Modeling of Musical Structures) ERC Advanced Grant</a>, led by Prof. Elaine Chew. I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Design Analytics and Music Physiology, focusing on human perception of musical stimuli.

### Lecturer @ LUL üë©üèº‚Äçüíª

Recently, in November, I left KCL and joined the <a href="https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/institutes/digital-technologies/">Institute for Digital Techhnologies at Loughborough University London</a> as a Lecturer. I am enjoying this new position so much already, particularly working with my students in the course I'm teaching - Digital Application Design - and introducing them to computer programming in Python. I'm looking forward to supervising projects and getting set up with my own grants and research work in the new year.

As before, I remain an Affiliate Researcher in the <a href ="https://sensint.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">Sensorimotor Interaction Group (senSInt)</a> at the MPI in Saarbr√ºcken, led by Dr. Paul Strohmeier, where I'm lucky to be able to continue my research work in interaction networks with my colleagues there. üíú

- Working on a collaborative projects module with sutdents at LUL
- TEI 2024 in Cork, IE, where I will present a full paper, a work-in-progress paper, and an arts track submission that have all been accepted (!) - stay tuned for more on that, I am so excited! üçÄ
- Hopefully being able to do my first bit of PhD supervision at LUL ü§ûüèª
