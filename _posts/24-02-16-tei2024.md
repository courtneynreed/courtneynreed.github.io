We're back from the <a href = "https://tei.acm.org/2024/">ACM 18th International Conference on Tangible Embedded and Embodied Interaction (TEI) </a> in Cork, IE! üçÄ

## there and back again üö¢

In an effort to be sustainable, the <a href ="https://sensint.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">Sensorimotor Interaction Group (senSInt)</a> trekked from Saarbr√ºcken across the channel via train to meet me in London, and then we took three trains, a ferry, and one more train to reach Cork and back - that's a total of 7 trains and 2 ferries!

## papers! 

senSInt presented some excellent research investigating material influences in eTextile interaction and designing wearables for investigating networks in music performance

**<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3623509.3633363">Base and Stitch: Evaluating eTextile Interfaces from a Material-Centric View</a>** üß∂

- Superstar Vineetha Rallabandi presented her MSc work which investigated the role of base fabrics in guiding gesture and their material agency in interaction with eTextiles.

**<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3623509.3635270">RaveNET: Connecting People and Exploring Liminal Space through Wearable Networks in Music Performance</a>** üß¢

- Rachel Freire demoed our RaveNET nodes - Bones, a wearable breath-sensing corset for voice, Tendons, a multisensor glove for gestures in bass-playing, and Veins, an EMG-based cap for facial expression - and their design processes.

**<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3623509.3635337">Liminal Space: A Performance with RaveNET</a>** üé§

- Along with Paul Strohmeier and Valentin Martinez-Missir, we performed Liminal Space to demonstrate RaveNET in action.

## blarney!

We had an excellent time getting Blarneyed - kissing the stone at Blarney Castle is meant to give the gift of the gab! Hoping that we can use some of that for our future paper writing. üòâ
