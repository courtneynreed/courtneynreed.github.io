DMI time with NIME and CHIME!: At the end of this year I presented work around designing vocal wearables and encoding experiences of timbre at the [New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)](https://www.nime2024.org/) conference in Utrecht, NL and the [Computer Human Interaction and Music nEtwork (CHIME) Annual Conference](https://www.chime.ac.uk/chime-annual-conference-2024) in Milton Keynes, UK. üé∂

## body lutherie & nime

I had a huge role during NIME this September as Paper Chair with Astrid Bin. It was definitely one of the most intense conference attendances I've had so far but the organising team did an amazing job and it really opened my eyes to the amount of passion, labour, and dedication that go into conferences. Especially those like NIME, which manage all the proceedings publication too!

I also presented a paper co-authored with Rachel Freire on our Body Lutherie practices to design the Bones anti-corset for vocal performance. Just a snip from the abstract on our work:

> [Body Lutherie: Co-Designing a Wearable for Vocal Performance with a Changing Body](https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Freire_NIME24_BodyLutherie.pdf)<br><br>"...Proposing a practice of ‚ÄúBody Lutherie‚Äù, we explore how digital instrument designers can honour and work with living, dynamic bodies. Our design of a breath-based vocal wearable instrument incorporated uncontrollable aspects of a vocalist‚Äôs body _(that's me!)_ and its physical change over different timescales. We distinguish the body in the design process and acknowledge its agency in vocal instrument design. Reflection on our co-design process between vocal pedagogy and eTextile fashion perspectives demonstrates how Body Lutherie can generate empathy and understanding of the body as a collaborator in future instrument design and artistic practice."

## enculturation & chime

In December, I also presented work around enculturation and value encording in Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design at the CHIME Conference at the Open University in Milton Keynes. It was great to connect with my local UK instrument design network and make some new friends working in this space. 

I presented a talk on [Enculturation and Value Encoding in the Design of Vocal DMIs](https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Reed_CHIME24_VocalEnculturation.pdf). Carrying this theme of value-encoding further in DMI design, my colleague Charis Saitis presented some ongoing work around designing for timbre and ethnography done at the Timbre Tools Hackathon. Also involved in this timbre work are Bleiz Macsen Del Sette, Jordan Shier, Haokun Tian, Shuoyang Zheng, Sophie Skach, Corey Ford, and myself: [Ethnographic Exploration of Timbre in Hackathon Designs](https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Saitis_CHIME24_TimbreEthno.pdf). 

This is also related to a recent publication we had at the 2024 Audio Mostly Conference, [Timbre Tools: Ethnographic Perspectives on Timbre and Sonic Cultures in Hackathon Designs](https://www.courtneynreed.com/assets/pdf/Saitis_AM24_TimbreTools.pdf).
