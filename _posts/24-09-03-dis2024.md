Just a short summer recap: had a relaxing time and presented research on designing with electromyography (EMG) during some excellent time spent at the <a href = "https://dis.acm.org/2024/">ACM International Conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS)</a> - my first time at DIS! - in always lovely Copenhagen, DK, the capital of design~ ‚òÄÔ∏è

## data entanglements

Andrew and I presented our paper, a collaboration with Landon Morrison, David Fierro, and Atau Tanaka during the conference:

**<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3643834.3661572">Sonic Entanglements with Electromyography: Between Bodies, Signals, and Representations</a>** üéª

- In this paper we examine our expectations of data and how we disrupt the very act of making music through our attempts to measure it. We focus on EMG sensing in digital musical instrument design, a commonality between our work, showing how EMG sensing reconfigures musicians' practice through its use, creating new interaction paradigms.

## new pubs

Two long-term projects I've collaborated on were finally published in August - it feels so good to have these available after so much work! PDFs for all of these papers are available below:

**Book Chapter: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003406273-1">Explainable AI and Music</a>** üë©üèº‚Äçüíª

- With Nick Bryan-Kinns, Berker Banar, Corey Ford, Yixiao Zhang, and Jack Armitage: <br>Our chapter in the new volume Artificial Intelligence for Art Creation and Understanding by CRC Press examines AI practices in music and how we can design through the lens of performers and composers for understandability in using generative music tools. 

**<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3689043">Shifting Ambiguity, Collapsing Indeterminacy: Designing with Data as Baradian Apparatus</a>** üé∏

- With Adan L. Benito, Franco Caspe, and Andrew McPherson: <br>Just accepted and soon-to-be published in the ACM Transactions on Computer Human Interaction (TOCHI) special issue on Prototyping with Uncertainty, we use Karen Barad's agential reality and theory on meaning-making to demonstrate how we distill the messiness of our world into digital mappings and create new phenomena through the apparatus.
